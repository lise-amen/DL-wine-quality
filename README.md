# DL-wine-quality
This project to let an AI predict the quality of a wine.

## Motivation 
I want to learn deep learning and I created my first neural network with keras. 

My objectives are : 
- Use a deep learning library (Keras)
- Prepare a data set for a machine learning model
- Put together a simple neural network
- Tune parameters of a neural network
